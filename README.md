# IMAGE-WATERMARKING
CMPE 362 Introduction to Signals for Computer Engineers -Term Project

This project provides a detailed comparative study between DCT and DWT-based watermarking techniques, as implemented in a project undertaken as part of a signal processing course for computer engineering. The discussion delves into the nuances of the mathematical foundations, algorithmic implementations, and the experimental results associated with both these techniques, thereby laying the groundwork for a more profound understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of digital watermarking. This project analysis is not only critical for assessing the performance of the implemented techniques but also for setting a robust foundation for future research and development in this field.
